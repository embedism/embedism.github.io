About Us 

</h2></header>



Embedism was founded by Chay Strawbridge and Nathan Ruttley. We have both worked in the product design industry for a number of years and noticed a gap in the services available to startups. Traditional consultancies are inflexible and expensive whilst one-man-bands are often unable to give you the attention you deserve.  

We started Embedism to be different to the others. We wanted to create a company that gets to know its customers on a deeper level, understanding that "I need this done" is often the only brief available, and that doesn't empty your startup's bank balance before you've even got over the starting line.  

Hardware doesn't have to be hard, it's our mission to make it easy.
