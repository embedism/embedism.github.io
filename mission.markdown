## Embedism's Mission  
### Affordable professional prototyping, electronics, and embedded firmware development.

*Embedism provides affordable engineering services to individuals and companies looking for professional prototypes and short-run production.*

*Our goal is to lower the barrier to entering the amazing world of hardware by offering fair pricing, industry-insider knowledge, and project structures that give you useful output at every stage. We do this by operating with low overheads, enthusiasm, and experienced, well-connected engineers.*

### Low Overheads
Embedism operates lean. Really lean. By operating with extremely low overheads we can pass on the savings to you and offer you the best engineering servies possible at an incredibly low price.

### Useful Project Outputs
We understand the money and time can be in short supply for a startup so we always provide useful project outputs at every stage of work. This could take the shape of a quick prototype that allows you to secure more investment, or some software that allows you to iterate on your ideas quickly. We will work with you to establish what you are trying to acheive and tailor our work to that.

### Great Connections
We have all been involved with consumer hardware since the start of our careers and have a great contact book that you can tap into. If you are looking to go into mass production, need a plastics DFM specialist, or need a PR agency, we can point you in the direction of great companies who can help.

### Enthusiasm
Our low overhead business model means that we don't have lavish company parties (that you would be paying for), so how do we stay enthused?. It's simple, we are obssesive about hardware, we live and breathe hardware. That makes getting up in the morning a breeze as we know we will love the challenges you throw at us.

### Experience
We've worked with a variety of hardware so we know what mistakes to avoid. Tap in to our deep knowledge of a huge range of platforms so you can get the hardware that you really need much earlier during your product's development.
