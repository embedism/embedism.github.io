## Partnerships
Hiring the right engineers for your growing team can be hard. Embedism takes that trouble away when you integrate us in to your team.

Embedism offers retainers on a rolling monthly basis. If you just need us for an hour a week to bounce ideas off, or you need us to carry out some lengthy R&D, we can be adaptable to suit your needs.

## Licensing
Our custom in-house tools and frameworks are available to license during the development and production phases of your product's lifecycle. Our tools can help you iterate faster during your R&D phases and reduce the time required for us to convert your ideas into production-ready firmware, this saves you time and money.

Get in touch with us to discuss your software and firmware licensing requirements and to find out what we have to offer.
